var serviceCmd = &cobra.Command{

	Short: "List all available services and their statuses",
	Long: `
DESCRIPTION

  List all available services and their statuses

  Use this command to list all running services on this machine.
  Services fall into main categories (GENERIC, GRPC, REST, API) and are then organized by tags (broker, data, idm, etc.)

EXAMPLE

  Use the --tags/-t flag to limit display to one specific tag, use lowercase for tags.

  $ ` + os.Args[0] + ` ps -t=broker
  Will result:
	- pydio.grpc.activity   [X]
	- pydio.grpc.chat       [X]
	- pydio.grpc.mailer     [X]
	- pydio.api.websocket   [X]
	- pydio.rest.activity   [X]
	- pydio.rest.frontlogs  [X]
	- pydio.rest.mailer     [X]
